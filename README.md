# ChemAi

This specialized chemistry chatbot allows users to input a chemical compound name or draw its structure using the SMILES method and retrieve detailed information about the compound. 
Users can also engage in a chat to get more in-depth information about the compound. This project is developed using **React.js**, **Redux.js**, **Typescript**, **Tailwind**, and **DaisyUi**.

Here is a [**Live Demo**](https://simamojtahedi.github.io/chem-ai/)

## Features
- Input Chemical Compound Name: Users can input the name of a chemical compound.
- Draw Structure using SMILES: Users can draw the structure of the chemical compound using the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation.
- Retrieve Information: The app provides detailed information about the compound, including its properties, uses, safety information, and more.
- Interactive Chat: Users can engage in a chat to get more information and ask specific questions about the compound.


## SMILES Method
The SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings. It allows users to draw the structure of a compound in a simple and standardized way.

## Chat Functionality
The app features an interactive chat that allows users to ask questions and get more detailed information about the chemical compound. The chat is powered by a chatbot that can understand and respond to queries related to chemical compounds.

## Examples
Here are a few examples of how you can use the app:

Input Chemical Compound Name:

Enter "Aspirin" and click on 'Send Button' to see detailed information about Aspirin.
Draw Structure using SMILES:

Draw the structure for "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O" (Aspirin) using the SMILES editor and retrieve information.
Interactive Chat:

Ask the chatbot "What are the uses of Aspirin?" and get a detailed response.
